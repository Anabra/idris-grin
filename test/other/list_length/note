Idris is clever, and if it sees that a data constructors field is never used, it deletes it GLOBALLY.
However, if there is even a single use site, it will keep them.

The directory "normal" contains the output of list_len.idr without the Show interface.
In this case, IDris can delete the first argument of the Cons data constructor.

Compile using:
stack exec -- idris-codegen-grin --output-dir="./normal2" --no-lint --O0 list_len.idr

If it does not work, then first load the file into the Idris REPL:
stack exec -- idris list_len.idr

Or simply use grin_generate

Note: Idris outputs the same code for all optimization levels.
